# HAR (Human activity recognition)
The objective of project is to analyze dataset of sensor based data of human activities.
By using human-engineered 561 features of 128 reading, our goal is to predict one of the six activities that a user perform

### INTRODUCTION:

Whilst camera-based data collection systems are limited to a predefined range, mobile sensor devices have unlimited range. Smartphones and wearables have a high autonomy and are thus capable of collecting and analysing data over longer time periods. Depending on the activity acceleration, orientation and other movement related signals are used. These can be enriched by environmental parameters such as temperature, noise or humidity.
Many successful applications of HAR use machine learning for pattern recognition due to its ability to generalize. To capture the temporal dependencies between the data recurrent neural networks (RNN) as well as long short-term memory (LSTM) are often applied.
The objective of the undertaking was to identify the percentage of waiting (standing), sitting, walking and jogging. This project comes under computer-vision statistical-based methodologies, syntactic methodologies and descriptions-based methodologies for hierarchical recognition are examined. Whilist camera-based data collection system are limited to a predefined range, mobile sensor devices have unlimited range.
Two of such sensors are: accelerometer (measures acceleration) and gyroscope (measures angular velocity), captures 3-dimensional linear acceleration and angular velocity
This is multi-class classification problem
